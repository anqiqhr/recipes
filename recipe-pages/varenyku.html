    <h2>Steps to Make Varenyky</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center and add the egg. Gradually mix in the warm water, kneading until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead on a floured surface for about 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft (about 15 minutes). Drain and mash until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, melt butter and sauté the onions until golden. Add to the mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cheese, season with salt and pepper, and let the mixture cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Varenyky:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch (3 mm) thickness.</li>
        <li>Use a round cutter or glass (2–3 inches in diameter) to cut out circles.</li>
        <li>Place 1 tsp of filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together, sealing tightly. You can crimp the edges for decoration.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Cook the Varenyky:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Carefully drop the varenyky in batches into the boiling water. Stir gently to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook until they float to the surface, plus an additional 2–3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5. Serve:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cooked varenyky in a serving dish and drizzle with melted butter to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream and garnish with fresh dill, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
